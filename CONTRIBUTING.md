# Contributing

We use the [fork and pull][gh-fork-pull] model to manage changes. More information
about [forking a repository][gh-fork] and [making a Pull Request][gh-pull].

This set of documents and codes evolves by making a concrete proposal for a
change (a pull request), followed by a discussion of that proposal within the
PR, and then merging or not the PR. The aim is to keep the discussions on topic
and concrete by not discussing topics without a concrete patch to discuss.

To contribute to this repository:

1. fork the repository on github
2. clone the repository
2. create a new branch in your clone `git checkout -b my-new-branch`
3. make your changes, commit them with a useful commit message
4. create a pull request

There is one additional rule: no one can merge their own pull requests, someone
else has to press the button

# Dependencies

All documents should be written in [markdown]() which is rendered automatically
when viewing the repository on github, to preview things locally [install Pandoc](http://www.pandoc.org/installing)
